# Simulation of electronic prescriptions process through the use of tokens
## Profesional Computing - CITS3200

An electronic prescription is a digital version of a paper prescription. Since the introduction of this process in May 2020, the Australian healthcare system has seen an uptake with over 189 million electronic prescriptions issued, more than 80,000 prescribers adopting electronic prescribing and at least 98% of all PBS-approved pharmacies having dispensed medications from electronic prescriptions. With efforts underway to expand electronic prescribing in hospitals and aged care settings, the next generation of healthcare requires proficient education and training in this area. For further information about How to get an Electronic prescription, please view this link: https://www.digitalhealth.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/electronic-prescriptions We, the Pharmacy department at School of Health and Clinical Sciences propose a simulation of part of the dispense process which involves the scanning of a QR code (token presented by patient) thereby transposing patient details into a copy of an electronic prescription (patient's prescription which the doctor has written). These details are then entered into a dispensing system by a pharmacist manually. We have examples of what a screenshot would look like on a patient's phone and the resulting information that would display on the computer once the QR code is scanned. We will require the simulation program to be editable by the Pharmacy Department for future educational purposes.
